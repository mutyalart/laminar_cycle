## Intro

[Laminar] is an awesome tool for creating [Functional Reactive][FRP] interfaces enterely based on [Streams][Airstream].

This repository offers a [tiny library][laminar-cycle-source] built on Laminar that can help you
build applications using [Cycle's dialogue abstraction][cycle-dialogue].

[cycle API][laminar-cycle-javadoc]

### Senses and Actuators

<img src="https://cycle.js.org/img/actuators-senses.svg" width="400">


In the [Cycle's dialogue abstraction][cycle-dialogue] pictured above, 
both the _Human_ and the _Computer_ can be seen as entities interacting with each
other by means of `Senses` to `Actuators`. 

These *Input* and *Output* devices drive the interaction between actors.

This way, the Computer _reacts_ to user interactions (like clicks) by *producing* an updated interface,
and the User _reacts_ to the interface on screen they *see* by *operating* on it (clicking again).

In [Cycle.js][Cycle], every component and the whole `Computer` can be seen like a function
from input streams to output streams.

```javascript
// Javascript
function computer(inputDevices) {
  // define the behavior of `outputDevices` somehow
  return outputDevices;
}
```

### Laminar.cycle

Since Laminar is already powerful enough to efficiently create and render stream-based reactive html elements,
all we need now is a function to model the previously seen cycle dialogue abstraction.

#### CycleIO

The type `CIO[I, O]` stands for `CycleIO` and models inputs of type `I` and outputs of type `O`.
> And yes, it's also a nod to the [ZIO] data type ;D -- [@vic]

As an example of _Inputs_ and _Outputs_, suppose you need to interact with
some external API by sending it `Request`s and receiving `Response`s from it.

Note: once you finish reading this guide, you might want to look at the [SWAPIDriver][swapi-driver-source]
example to see how to implement a [Cycle driver][cycle-driver] in Laminar.

```scala
object ExternalAPI {
  sealed trait Request
  sealed trait Response
}
```

In the following code snippet, we have a `computer` function that can take
stimulus (`Response`) from the API but also might produce stimulus for it (`Request`).

```scala
import cycle._
import com.raquo.laminar.api.L._
import ExternalAPI.{Request, Response}

def computer(api: CIO[Response, Request]) = {
  // TODO: send requests and receive responses from API
}
```

You can think of the `CIO[Input, Output]` type as the following trait.
> If you want to know the truth, use the source, Luke.
> You will see it's actually defined as type alias in [Cycle.scala][laminar-cycle-source]
> -- [@vic][@vic]

```scala
trait CIO[I, O] {
  val in:  EventStream[I]
  val out: WriteBus[O]
}
```

it provides an incoming `Observable[I]` stream and an outgoing `Observer[O]` write bus.

Pretty much similar to [Airstream]'s own `EventBus[T]` but generic on both input and output types.


#### Combining state and user interaction.

Suppose we want to implement a counter UI that is able to track the current counter value
and the number of times the user has interacted with the counter.
A working example can be found at [Examples](#Examples)

```scala
object Counter {

  case class State(
    value: Int,
    numberOfInteractions: Int
  )
  
  sealed trait Action // Type of the sensed stimulus produced by the user
  case object Increment extends Action
  case object Decrement extends Action

}
```

Having the above types, we could define our `computer` function like:

```scala
import Counter._

def computer(states: EIO[State], actions: EIO[Action]): Mod[Element] = {
  // Initialize the computer's internal state and keep it on a Signal[State]
  // in order to always have a *current value*
  val stateSignal: Signal[State] = states.startWith(State(0, 0))
  
  // Now, whenever we sense a user Action, we have to update our current state
  val updatedState: EventStream[State] = 
     actions.withCurrentValueOf(stateSignal).map(Function.tupled(performAction))
 
  updatedState --> states
}

def performAction(action: Action, state: State): State = action match {
 case Increment =>
   state.copy(state.value + 1, state.numberOfInteractions + 1)
 case Decrement =>
   state.copy(state.value - 1, state.numberOfInteractions + 1)
}
```

Let's explore our previous example code.

* The `EIO[E]` type is just an alias for `CIO[E, E]`. 

  EIO stands for Equal IO, meaning that both, input and output have the same type `E`.
  It's equivalent to [Airstream]'s `EventBus[E]`

* Our previous example does not render anything (we will get to producing views later).

  Yet, it's a fully working example of how to create a cycle function that reads and writes
  from both: `actions` and `states`.

* The return type is `Mod[Element]`. 

  The `updatedState --> states` produces Laminar modifier that manages the event subscriptions. 
  From now on we will be using the `type ModEl = Mod[Element]` alias included with this lib.
  
  Read more about modifiers and subscription ownership at [LaminarDocs].
  All of this is part of Laminar's [memory safety and glitch free guarantees][LaminarSafety].


#### Producing reactive views

Now, we will refactor our `computer` function to actually render a user interface.

For brevity sake, we will add `???` for previously seen code.

```scala
def computer(states: EIO[State], actions: EIO[Action]): Div = {
  val stateSignal: Signal[State] = ???
  val updatedState: EventStream[State] = ???
 
  div(
    counterView(stateSignal),
    actionControls(actions),
    updatedState --> state
  )
}

def actionControls(actions: Observer[Action]): Mod[Div] = {
  cycle.amend(
    button(
      cls := "btn secondary",
      "Increment",
      onClick.mapTo(Increment) --> actions
    ),
    button(
      cls := "btn secondary",
      "Decrement",
      onClick.mapTo(Decrement) --> actions
    ),
    button(
      cls := "btn secondary",
      "Reset",
      onClick.mapTo(Reset) --> actions
    )
  )
}

def counterView(state: Observable[State]): Div = {
  div(
    h2("Counter value: ", child.text <-- state.map(_.value.toString)),
    h2("Interactions: ", child.text <-- state.map(_.interactions.toString))
  )
}
```
  
## Drivers  

A [Driver][cycle-driver] is the Cycle-way to interpret effects and
interact with the outside world.


In Laminar, Drivers normally look like:

```scala
object FooDriver {
 
  // The Config type can be whatever context your driver needs
  // in order to work properly. Some drivers need no config at all.
  case class Config(debug: Boolean = false)

  // The type of all possible inputs to this driver.
  sealed trait Input
  case object Foo extends Input
  case object Moo extends Input
 
  // The type of all possible outputs of this driver.
  sealed trait Output
  case object Bar extends Output
  case object Baz extends Output

  // The type of IO devices as seen from the User perspective.
  // eg, Users of this driver, take our Output as their input and our Input as their output type.
  type UserIO = CIO[Output, Input]

  // This is the driver constructor, you can name this function whatever you like
  // and have several of them. If you have a config object, curry it.
  def apply(config: Config): Cycle[UserIO, ModEl] = { user: User[UserIO] =>
  
    // Here we create a cyclic pair of IO streams. Conveniently aliases as PIO[I, O]
    // pio is an object that holds four streams:
    //  in[Input](pio) => EventStream[Input] ; out[Output](pio) => WriteBus[Output]
    //  in[Output](pio) => EventStream[Output] ; out[Input](pio) => WriteBus[Input]
    val pio = PIO[Input, Output]

    val outputs: EventStream[Output] = pio.flatMap { input =>
       // Produce a new Output stream as the result of sensing an Input
       EventStream.fromValue(perform(input), emitOnce = true)
    }
  
    amend(
       outputs --> pio, // Send all produced Outputs to the in[Output] port of `pio`
       user(pio) // Call the user function, providing pio as `UserIO`
    )
  }
 
  // Upon receiving an Input, we have to produce an Output
  private def perform(input: Input): Output = input match {
    case Foo => Bar
    case Moo => Baz
  }

}
```

Drivers are used in the following way:

```scala
import FooDriver._
val ui = div(
  FooDriver(config = Config) { foo: FooDriver.UserIO =>
    val receivedResponse: EventStream[String] = foo.map { 
      case Bar => "You pressed Foo"
      case Baz => "You pressed Moo"
    }

    val lastResponse: Signal[String] = receivedResponse.startWith("Nothing yet, click the button!")

    div(
       child <-- lastResponse,
       button(
         "Produce Foo request for driver",
         onClick.mapTo(Foo) --> foo
       ),
       button(
         "Produce Moo request for driver",
         onClick.mapTo(Moo) --> foo
       )
     ) 
  }
)
```

Of course not all drivers are like this, some could provide only an input-device to their users,
other might also want to provide more than just an `InOut`.
